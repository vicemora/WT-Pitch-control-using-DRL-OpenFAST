RL-Based Pitch Control: Simulation Setup with OpenFAST and Simulink

1.Simulation setup with OpenFAST and Simulink 

To evaluate the performance of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms under realistic operating conditions, we use the OpenFAST simulator developed by NREL. To be able to use OpenFAST from the Simulink environment,  you must download the binaries available in the official OpenFAST GitHub repository:

OpenFAST v4.0.4 â€“ GitHub Release

Specifically, you will need the following files:
